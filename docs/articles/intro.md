# Legerity for Uno

Legerity for Uno is an extension library to the [Legerity framework](https://made-apps.github.io/legerity/). It is designed to be used for building automated UI tests quickly for your Uno Platform applications with C#.

This library simplifies your development by providing easy-to-use platform element wrappers for Uno Platform controls that allow you to quickly get up and running with UI tests with minimal effort. 

Taking advantage of the Legerity framework, you'll also get access to UI test best practice components, such as a page object pattern implementation, for building future-proof UI tests that you can easily maintain.

## Why should I use this project?

Do you find it difficult to get started with UI tests? Think that they take too long to build and become unmaintainable?

So did we!

That's where Legerity for Uno comes in, a toolkit on top of Selenium that makes UI test development fast and easy. This allows us to spend more time building applications with confidence that our customers get the best, most tested experience.
