Want to generate your Legerity page objects super fast? üöÄ

The Legerity for Uno Platform page object generator CLI tool allows you to auto-generate page objects for your Uno Platform application based on the contained `Page` XAML files.

Just provide an input path, output path, and output namespace and you're away! ü§©

## Getting started

### Install the tool

```bash
dotnet tool install -g Legerity.Uno.PageObjectGenerator
```

**Or update an existing install**

```bash
dotnet tool update -g Legerity.Uno.PageObjectGenerator
```

### Run the tool

Once you have the tool installed, it is simply a case of running the CLI and providing the input, output, and namespace arguments.

```bash
legerity-uno-pop -i "path/to/input/folder" -o "path/to/output/folder" -n "My.Namespace"
```

This will read through all the `Page` XAML files that can be found under the input folder, generate a Legerity `BasePage` equivalent based on supported elements, and then drop those into your output folder. And that's it!
