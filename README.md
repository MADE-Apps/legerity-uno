- **Testing Frameworks** - Legerity for Uno Platform is agnostic of .NET testing frameworks (e.g. NUnit, xUnit, MSTest, etc.) so you can work with what you know.
- **CI** - Legerity for Uno Platform is also agnostic of host CI runner platforms (e.g. GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, etc.) and can be run anywhere.

Even better, why not help build out your custom control wrapper elements within the framework and help out the community!

### UI Automation tooling üß∞

When contributing to new element wrappers, we recommended using the [Accessibility Insights tool](https://accessibilityinsights.io/en/). The tool is capable of inspecting and providing property values for Android, Web, and Windows applications.

Alternatively, you can use the [Inspect.exe tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winauto/inspect-objects) for Windows applications installed with the Windows SDKs. This is not recommended as the tool is considered legacy and can often cause oddities in UI when using.

For your Uno Platform web application, you can also use F12 developer tools to inspect your application layout tree.
